git practice:
==============
git is a distributed and centralized version control system.
 
what is version control:
=======================
updating the source code and saving the older source code.

local repository & remote repository:
=====================================
remote repository is available to all(GitHub, bitbucket, GitLab there are servers). 
local repo is not available to all(git is a local repo we can download the git and connect to the server which means we create an account in any remote server). 
so we have two storages in in remote repository and local repository.

git status :
============
git status is a command that shows the current state of the working directory and the staging area.

Working Directory:
==================
This is where you make changes to files. These changes are not tracked by Git until you stage or commit them.

Staging area(or)Index:
======================
If we want to commit some file or file to tack care by git. The file should be at staging area means at local repository.

After making changes in the working directory, you can move them to the staging area using the git add command.

Git Repository (.git directory):
================================
This is the actual Git database where commits (snapshots of your project) are stored. Once changes are staged, you can commit them to the repository.
